"""
step_09_ladder.py — Every series takes the rate of its final group (step 08), reinforced by
credibility with the group's reference; and gets its two errors and its risk level.

"The group lends its rate to its series; a group without precision trusts its own rate in
proportion to how much support it has, and the rest comes from a wider reference."

THE RATE OF THE GROUP: Σ renewed / Σ due of all the series of the final group (step 08).
THE CREDIBILITY (only for a final group below own_rate_floor, 271, with a reference):
  z = n / (n + k), n = the support of the group, k = Bühlmann-Straub k of its reference,
  estimated from the final groups that share that reference: within variance / between
  variance of their rates (fewer than 3 groups: k_cred; no between variance: 10 × k_cred).
  estimated rate = z · rate of the group + (1 − z) · rate of the reference
  A group at or above own_rate_floor predicts alone: z = 1.
Every series of a group gets the same estimated rate (the group lends it). Two errors, in pp:
  · se_estimacion: the error of the ESTIMATE, √(z²·se_group² + (1−z)²·se_reference²)
  · se_prediccion: √(se_estimacion² + se_binomial(rate, n_propio)²): next month still samples
    with the series' OWN size. It never shrinks below its own binomial noise.
THE RISK LEVEL: how the rate was obtained, by the pass where the group of the series was formed:
  A  the series itself (pass 0) with own precision (≥ own_rate_floor), a year of history
  A2 the same, less than a year
  A3 the series itself with evidence (≥ support_floor) but not precision: credibility
  B  merged in the sign or extra passes: its group shares EVERY mandatory dim with it
  C  merged in a mandatory pass (a mandatory dim collapsed), or never reached the floor
  S  signed and its group never reached the floor
  M  mixed signs: never merged · D solo_futuro · N solo_historia

Series that are not estimable (solo_historia, solo_futuro, mixto) get their row
too: their own group, their own rate if they have one, and their level.

Actions (logged as they are done):
  1. the final group and the reference of every estimable series (step 08)
  2. the credibility k of every reference, from the groups that share it
  3. the rate and the two errors of every series (the others: their own rate, if any)
  4. the risk level of every series
  5. check the rates and the errors                                   checks 1-4
  6. write the estimate of every series and the money by level        checks 5-6
  7. count the checks; stop if any failed
  8. show the money by risk level and what each level means, as tables

Checks (logged as they are made, numbered, at the level of their status):
   1. every series has exactly one estimate
   2. every series of a group has the same estimated rate
   3. every estimated rate and every z is between 0 and 1
   4. the prediction error is never below the estimation error
   5. table sff_niveles_riesgo written and read back

Output: one row per series with its final group, reference, k, z, estimated rate, two errors
and risk level (in memory: it reaches the forecast series dimension) · the money by risk level ·
table sff_niveles_riesgo.
