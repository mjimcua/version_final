"""synthetic.py — synthetic dataset v3 (test tooling).

Calendar (designed for "train on all history, test on the 2026 months that already
happened, forecast the rest of 2026, extend into 2027"):

  2023-01 .. 2025-12   train      (36 months)
  2026-01 .. 2026-08   test       (8 months with truth: the 2026 months already happened)
  2026-09              CURRENT month (labeled test on purpose: the doctrine must reassign it)
  2026-09 .. 2026-12   projection (known pipeline, no results)

FEATURE-COVERAGE MATRIX (feature → scenario), kept from v2 and extended:
  exhaustive config   → optional leftover column
  conservation        → discount combinations inside one forecast unit
  universes / routes  → flag_time_series, train_only (no_impact), projection_only (heuristic)
  gaps                → NA|B tele with months missing inside its history
  sign grouping       → small EU negatives (15/12/10: only together they cross 30) + a minority positive
  extra annulment     → channel mute (same rates on web and tele; tele small)
  mandatory ladder    → NA|A tele neutral small, cell NA has support
  mixed sign          → ONE series with dormant=1 and autorenew=1 (must stay alone)
  mix-shift → NA: product A (.90, weight falling) vs B (.50, weight rising)
  seasonality         → EU|A yearly sine, amplitude 5 pp, 3 full cycles
  trend               → EU|B declining .86 → .64 over 44 months (must saturate)
  uplift              → newcust+d40 at 1.5 vs veterans 1.03 / d40 1.10
  current month       → 2026-09 labeled test, carrying early results to be wiped
