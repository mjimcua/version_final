step_10_pool_series.py — The monthly series of every final group: what the backtest judges.

After the ladder (steps 08-09) every estimable series belongs to ONE final group, and the
group lends its rate to its series. The rate that will be forecast is the rate of that
group, month by month. This step builds that monthly series: for every final group, the
units due and renewed of every series in its rate (the ones that use it and the ones that
only lend their history) are summed month by month, and its rate is Σ renewed / Σ due of the
month. A lender is in more than one composition: summing every composition does NOT add up
to the raw (the portfolio is taken from the series themselves, step 11).

Only closed truth months enter (entrenamiento, examen): the gaps and the future have no
rate. Every id also gets a reference row: its months, its support (the median units due
of a month), its rate over all its months, how many series take their rate from it, the
money they have to predict, and its GATE:
  · nivel    support ≥ support_floor: the backtest will judge its techniques
  · soporte  support below the floor: not judged, it will take the default technique

Actions (logged as they are done):
  1. the compositions of step 08 and every series in their rate (users and lenders)
  2. the monthly series of every id (units due and renewed summed; rate)
  3. the reference of every id: months, support, rate, series, money, gate
  4. check the series and the reference                             checks 1-3
  5. write the series and the reference                             checks 4-5
  6. count the checks; stop if any failed
  7. show the ids by gate and the largest ones, as tables

Checks (logged as they are made, numbered, at the level of their status):
   1. every chosen estimation id has a monthly series
   2. the support of every group equals its support in step 08
   3. every monthly rate is between 0 and 1                         (warning only)
   4-5. tables sff_pool_serie and sff_pool_referencia written and read back

Output: (the monthly series of every id, long: id × month; the reference of every id)
· tables sff_pool_serie, sff_pool_referencia.
