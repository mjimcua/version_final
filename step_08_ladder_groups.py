"""
step_08_ladder_groups.py — The ladder: the series are merged pass by pass into bigger groups
until every group has enough support, and every group gets a credibility reference.

THE IDEA: the forecast series of the raw (with its gaps) are the starting point. Each PASS gives
every series a group id. Grouping the numbers by the id of any pass gives the same totals as
the raw, but fewer and bigger series, with better binomial support. The report of the passes
shows how much each pass improves the support.

THE PASSES, in this order (a pass is skipped if it has nothing to do):
  0            itself: the group id is the series itself
  1            sign: the timevarying flags are summarised as their sign (SIG=negativo, …)
  extras       one pass per extra_renovacion, the least informative first (unique contribution
               of step 07): its value becomes '*'
  mandatory    one pass per mandatory dim, in the collapse order of step 07 (the dim whose loss
               costs the least R² first; a *_level_N before its *_level_N−1): its value becomes '*'

THE RULE OF A PASS: group the series by the id of the previous pass. A group with a support
≥ support_floor (30) is CLOSED: it keeps its id in every later pass. The series of an open group
take the id of this pass (one more dim set to '*'). So every pass is a partition: each series
is in one group, and the totals by group always add up to the raw.
  · a signed group (negativo / positivo) keeps its sign: it only goes through the mandatory
    passes while the cumulative loss of R² is ≤ signed_ladder_max_loss
  · a mixed series (flags of both signs) is never merged: it stays itself
  · support of a group = the median, over its months with something due, of the units due
    summed over its series

AN ID ONLY CHANGES WHEN THE GROUP CHANGES: when a pass sets one more dim to '*' but the group
keeps exactly the same series, it keeps the id it had. So reading the ids pass after pass, an id
changes only where the series really joined others.

THE STAGES: the passes are summarised in the 4 stages business reads (one column pair per stage
in the core, stage_id and stage_support):
  stage 0  raw      the forecast series itself (its gaps filled)
  stage 1  sign     after the sign pass
  stage 2  extras   after the last extra pass
  stage 3  collapse after the last mandatory pass: the COMPOSITION, what is predicted
  (stage 4, credibility, is step 09: it blends rates, it does not merge series)
A stage that adds nothing repeats the id and the support of the stage before it.

THE COMPOSITION of a series is its id after the last pass. The group lends its rate to every
series in it (step 09). A final group below own_rate_floor (271) gets a CREDIBILITY REFERENCE:
a wider group whose rate is blended with the group's own, z = n / (n + k). The reference is the
first of these candidates that has more series than the group and reaches support_floor
(else the widest one that has more series):
  · the group's own id, counted over ALL the series (also the ones closed in earlier passes,
    the big ones included)
  · the id of each later pass its sign allows, counted over all the series
A reference is a source of rate, not a group of the partition: the same series can be in the
reference of many groups. Every series has ONE reference, so the series still add up by it,
but the rate of a reference is computed with every series that matches it.

Actions (logged as they are done):
  1. the plan of the passes, from the decision of step 07
  2. the estimable series with their sign and their columns
  3. the id of every series at every pass (and of every possible pattern, for the references)
  4. the passes: close the groups that reach the floor, move the others one pass up
  5. the final group of every series, and the credibility reference of every final group
  6. check the partition, the signs, the closed groups and the references      checks 1-4
  7. write the passes, their summary, the merges and the composition members    checks 5-8
  8. count the checks; stop if any failed
  9. show how every pass improves the support, as a table

Output: (the passes: series × pass with its group id, the summary by pass, the final group of
every series with its reference, the members of every reference) · tables sff_ladder_steps,
sff_ladder_summary, sff_ladder_merges, sff_composition_members (the final groups stay in memory).
