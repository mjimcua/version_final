"""
step_12_backtest.py — The backtest of the renewal rate: which technique predicts each pool
best, how precise it is, and how wide its error band must be.

HOW THE TEST WORKS (it is also written in the log, with the months of the run):
  · WHAT IS JUDGED: the monthly series of every estimation id with support (gate 'nivel',
    step 10). An id below the floor is not judged: it takes the default technique.
  · TWO KINDS OF TARGET MONTHS, never mixed:
      selection  the backtest_selection_months (6) closed months BEFORE the exam: the
                 techniques are compared on them and the best one is CHOSEN
      exam       the exam months of the calendar (test_months, 3): used only to MEASURE
                 the chosen technique, which never saw them while being chosen
  · NO PEEKING: for a target month T and a horizon h, every technique sees only the
    months up to T − h, exactly as it would have been in real life h months earlier
    (h = 1: next month; h = 6: six months ahead). It needs at least
    backtest_min_history_months of history.
  · THE ERROR: err_pp = 100 · (predicted − real rate). It is compared with the error chance
    alone would cause in that month, the binomial error of the real rate with the month's
    own units: err_norm = err_pp / se_binom_pp. |err_norm| ≈ 1 is as good as any forecast
    can be; 3 means three times the noise.
  · THE CHOICE, per id and horizon band (corto = h 1, medio_largo = h 2-6): the technique
    with the lowest mean |err_norm| in the selection months REPLACES the default technique
    (T3_ma3, the moving average of 3 months) only if it beats it by the band's margin
    (0.10 near, 0 far). A technique competes where its minimum history is reached (the
    seasonal ones need 13 and 24 months): only the history limits, no seasonality verdict.
    The ranking of the techniques is computed on the targets where ALL of them competed.
  · THE BAND, per technique and horizon: the 5 % and 95 % quantiles of err_norm in the
    selection months, over every judged id. In the exam, 90 % of the errors of the chosen
    technique should fall inside it.
  · THE PRECISION, in the exam months: per id (chosen vs default technique) and for the TOTAL:
    Σ predicted renewals vs Σ real renewals of all judged ids, month by month.

OUTPUT TABLES (long format: one row per prediction, not one table or column per technique;
each id competes with the techniques its history allows, and Power BI pivots it):
  sff_backtest_predicciones  id × target month × horizon × technique: predicted, real, errors
  sff_decision_tecnica       id × horizon band: the chosen technique, its error, the default technique's
  sff_decision_bandas        technique × horizon: the error quantiles
  sff_backtest_examen        id × horizon band: the chosen vs the default technique in the exam
  sff_backtest_examen_total  exam month × horizon: the error of the total renewals

Actions (logged as they are done):
  1. the calendar of the test: selection and exam months, horizons, and how it works
  2. the predictions of every technique for every judged id, target and horizon
  3. the choice of every id and horizon band
  4. the error bands of every technique and horizon
  5. the precision in the exam: per id and for the total
  6. check the test                                                 checks 1-5
  7. write the five tables                                          checks 6-10
  8. count the checks; stop if any failed
  9. show the ranking of the techniques, the choices and the precision in the exam

Checks (logged as they are made, numbered, at the level of their status):
   1. no prediction saw its target month or anything after its origin
   2. every estimation id has a decision in every horizon band
   3. the default technique was predicted wherever another technique was
   4. the ranking compares the techniques on common targets (every technique competed)
   5. in the exam, the band holds at least 80 % of the chosen technique's errors (nominal 90 %)
                                                                     (warning only)
   6-10. the five tables written and read back

Output: (the predictions, the decision per id and band, the error bands, the exam per id,
the exam of the total) · the six tables above.
