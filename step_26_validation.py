"""
step_26_validation.py — The final validation: does everything agree, from the raw to the forecast?

Each step checked its own work. This step checks the chain ACROSS steps, once everything
has run, and leaves the result in one table:
  · the money: Σ USD due of the extract = Σ of the fine table = Σ of the forecast units;
    the future USD due of the extract = Σ USD due of the forecast
  · every series with money to predict has a rate and a risk level
  · every future row takes its rate from its series' estimation id when it has one
  · the forecast is coherent with the past: the expected rate of the future (USD) is within
    ±15 pp of the last closed year's (warning: a larger jump must be explained)
  · the precision measured in the exam of the portfolio (step 19, series by series): the
    error of the total renewals is within ±10 % in every exam month (warning: the forecast is
    less reliable than promised)

Actions (logged as they are done):
  1. the money along the chain
  2. the coverage of the series and the forecast rows
  3. the coherence of the forecast with the past and with the exam
  4. write the validation                                            check 7
  5. count the checks; stop if any failed

Checks (logged as they are made, numbered, at the level of their status):
   1. Σ USD due: extract = fine table = forecast units
   2. the future USD due of the extract = Σ USD due of the forecast
   3. every series with money to predict has a rate and a risk level
   4. every future row of a series with an estimation id takes its rate from the pool
   5. the expected rate of the future is within ±15 pp of the last closed year's   (warning only)
   6. the error of the total renewals in the exam is within ±10 %                   (warning only)
   7. table sff_validacion written and read back

Output: the validation (one row per check) · table sff_validacion.
